This project focuses on license plate recognition using computer vision techniques and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The provided code implements various image processing steps, including gamma correction, edge detection, contour detection, and cropping to isolate license plate regions from images. The project also utilizes Tesseract OCR for text extraction from license plate images. By combining these techniques, the project aims to accurately detect and extract license plate information from images.
